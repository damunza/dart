## Project : Dart 
## Author : Damunza

### Description
This was a project undertaken solely because i didn't appreciate flask as a backend langage following a task i was given. future employers who need flask native apps stop HERE. The reason for not appreciating it is because of the number of files needed for a project to work just that.

### Order
Lesson1 : basics 
lesson2 : data types
lesson3 : opperators
lesson4 : conditional statements and loops
lesson5 : collections- maps, lists, sets
lesson6 : functions
lesson7 : oop
lesson8 : error handling

### Challenges 

##### joke of the read me: 
```i had to learn Indian. This isnt a language i can speak just tha my brown 'brother' dare i say staid in india a little too long 
```
- class inheritance and polymorphism
```
- @overide is ok but calling a method to call a method to call a statement isn't efficient
- exception and supper for inheritance yes they work well just that the output on the first call took me on atrip because i saw double values.thank the 'brother' for this for this 
```
-getters and setters 
```
i will read on them just as soon as i need them because they didnt seem important even while being described 
```
- error handling 
```
- for future students - the variable you call when verifying if there is an error at the begining is an instance value returned by the testing function. It returns a null value if the test function cathches an exception and returns an actuall value for non errors 
- on the other ways of dealing with errors i say: if it works leave it, account for all deviation made until you need to make a change 
```

### Short Comings 

i have not included any built in packages so ...
